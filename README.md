# Kanji Art Generator (ASCII Art with Kanji)

Concept: Combine kanji with ASCII art to create fun visuals. For example, you could take a kanji character (like 火 for "fire") and use ASCII characters to form a picture related to that kanji.

Challenge: You’d need to combine text manipulation with visual design, and it would be fun to figure out how to make these creations look cool using only text.

User Interaction: Users could input a word/kanji, and the program could generate a corresponding visual or ASCII art representation of that kanji.
